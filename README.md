<b>Source & Scope</b><br>
The data come from the Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey, which asks Americans key questions about their lives to measure the pandemic’s social and economic impacts. Questions about energy use and spending abilities were added in Phase 3.2 of the survey, which launched on July 21, 2021. This analysis draws on the 15 surveys that have included these questions, from survey week 34 in late July 2021 through survey week 48 in early August 2022. The responses for each survey were aggregated by state and by 15 major metro areas.<br>

<b>Survey Questions & Answers</b><br>
The responses included in these datasets answer the following questions:<br>
- In the last 12 months, how many months did your household reduce or forego expenses for basic household necessities, such as medicine or food, in order to pay an energy bill?<br>
- In the last 12 months, how many months did your household keep your home at a temperature that you felt was unsafe or unhealthy?<br>
- In the last 12 months, how many times was your household unable to pay an energy bill or unable to pay the full bill amount?<br>

Each question allowed respondents to choose from the following answers:<br>
- Almost every month<br>
- Sometimes<br>
- 1 or 2 months<br>
- Never<br>

Some respondents did not respond to certain questions. These non-responses were excluded from the rate and likelihood ratio calculations.<br>

<b>Analysis & Column Descriptions</b><br>
Column A of each dataset lists the demographic groups broken out by the Census Pulse Survey, including gender, race, income, age and many more characteristics. Columns B-Q of each dataset contain sums of raw results from 15 surveys spanning July 2021-August 2022. Columns R-T contain percentages of each group’s respondents that reported some level of the given experience (either almost every month, sometimes, or one or two months). Columns U-W contain likelihood ratios of each experience for each group – comparing those respondents’ likelihood to have reported some level of the given experience to the overall likelihood of all respondents. A likelihood ratio of one means that group was as likely to report the experience as the average respondent; a higher ratio means they were more likely to report the experience, and a lower ratio means they were less likely to report it.<br>

<b>Tips for Further Analysis</b><br>
To calculate likelihood ratios between different demographic groups (rather than between one group and all respondents), divide the percent reporting the experience (Columns R-T) in one group by the percent reporting it in the other group. For example, if I wanted to see if there is a sex-based disparity in being unable to pay energy bills, I would divide the rate in Column T of female respondents (Row 11) by the rate in Column T of male respondents (Row 10). In the Philadelphia Metro Area, the result is about 1.5, meaning that female respondents were one-and-a-half times as likely to report being unable to pay their energy bill as male respondents.<br>

Here are some of the groups that tended to report these experiences at higher rates – Remember that some of these categories are likely to overlap:<br>
1.	Respondents who are unable to see, hear, walk/climb stairs, or remember/concentrate
2.	Respondents with household incomes below $50,000 (especially those below $25,000) and those reporting a loss of household employment income within the last four weeks
3.	Respondents with less than a high school education
4.	Respondents who are non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic or Latino
5.	Respondents who are transgender
6.	Respondents with five or more people in their household
7.	Respondents with children in their household
8.	Respondents who are divorced/separated
9.	Respondents recently borrowing from friends or family or using government assistance (ex. rental assistance, SNAP, school meal debit/EBT cards) to meet their spending needs
10.	Respondents serving in the Reserve or National Guard or those with a spouse serving<br>
 
The above list is just a starting point for finding some of the disparities that may exist in your area. Compare the rates and likelihood ratios for all respondent groups in your metro’s dataset to find who is most at-risk locally. <br>
